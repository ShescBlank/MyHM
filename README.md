# MyHM 

[IN DEVELOPMENT]

Custom hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) compression method made in Python and accelerated with Numba.

This code is part of my master's work at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile with Professor Elwin van 't Wout. The main objective is to apply H-matrix compression to high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) contexts, seeking to compare and couple simulations of homogeneous and heterogeneous materials, as well as to study the changes produced in the ultrasound focus. The homogeneous simulations were made based on the Bempp-cl library ([bempp-cl](https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl/tree/main)) with the Boundary Element Method. On the other hand, the heterogeneous simulations were based on the research work of Danilo Aballay (research partner with the same professor) in Volume Integral Equations ([github profile](https://github.com/daniloaballayf)).

The entire repository is under development and is updated on a regular basis.
